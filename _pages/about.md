# <font size=6>Hello professor, Welcome to Yang Chen's homepage! 🤞</font>

**Yang Chen Biography** <br>

Yang Chen is currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Hong Kong. Before that, he received his dual bachelor degrees from Chang'an University (211 Project), Xi'an, China, and University College Dublin (2025 QS World University Ranking: 126), Ireland. At these two institutions, he earned a B.Eng. degree in Transportation and a B.Sc. degree (**First Class Honours**) in Transport, City Planning & Environmental Policy, respectively.

During his undergraduate studies, Yang Chen had accumulated extensive research experience. After the pandemic (nearly 2 years of pitiful dormitory life 😥), starting from the summer between his sophomore and junior years, he led a Provincial College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program as the project leader and participated as the second leader in a National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program. Both projects explored safety issues encountered by human drivers from the perspectives of human factors and traffic safety, focusing on issues such as pedal misapplication and visual blind spots.

Since then, Yang Chen developed research interests in **traffic safety, human factors, and intelligent transportation**. Throughout the subsequent two years of his undergraduate studies, he came up with many ideas and conducted much research at the School of Automobile, Chang'an University, and the Key Laboratory of Automobile Transportation Safety Technology, Ministry of Transport, China. He served as a **part-time research assistant**, leading projects such as **topics in L2-level human-machine co-driving modes** (e.g., fatigue, distraction, driving habits, etc.), **interactions between vulnerable traffic participants** (e.g., pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, etc.) **and autonomous vehicles in VR environments**, and **evaluation of motion sickness characteristics in electric vehicle passengers** (with the latter two projects still ongoing 😀).

<br>
**Research Interests:**
1. Intelligent transportation system
1. Autonomous vehicles, AV
1. Traffic safety
1. Human factors, driver behaviors, driving simulator
1. VR, interaction between traffic participants and AVs

1. [Wu, F.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fuwei-Wu)(Supervisor), Sun, W., **Chen, Y.**, et al. (2024) A Comparative Study on Pedestrian Perception of Vehicle Movement Information in Virtual Reality and Real-world Environments 虚实环境下行人对车辆运动信息感知特性对比研究. Submitted to *Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology 交通运输系统工程与信息* (EI, IF=2.27). **Under review**.<br>
* Description: This paper examines vehicle speed and arrival time estimation in real and VR environments. It finds that pedestrians generally underestimate vehicle speed in VR but their arrival time estimates remain consistent. Vehicle speed consistently affects perceptual bias across both settings, while individual characteristics do not significantly alter perception differences. These insights offer valuable theoretical references for pedestrian-vehicle interactions in VR environments.

(2024) Experimental Studies of Passenger Motion Sickness for Electric Bus Dynamical Characteristics under Different Operating Conditions. **In preparation**.<br>
* Description: Since road public transportation systems in many cities are currently equipped with electric buses, however, their dynamic characteristics under different urban commuting conditions are still uncertain concerning the passengers' motion sickness levels. Therefore, in this paper, we will take the electric bus commuting network in Xi'an, China, as an example to explore the motion sickness characteristics of passengers traveling on electric buses. Simulation and other means will be employed to explore how to reduce or inhibit this phenomenon.

* Description: This paper is supposed to be an extended version of my undergraduate thesis. We will conduct our research based on the current relatively novel SIND dataset and introduce some deep learning and machine learning models to build our own modeling framework. I believe it is fundamental research to study non-motorized operating behavior, and subsequently, I will continue to expand to human factors, human-vehicle interaction, and other aspects to deepen the value of this research.
